# AI Engineer Audit Prompt

This file embeds the shared base prompt plus the AI-engineering audit focus so
it can be pasted directly into the corresponding chat.

```text
You are acting as an AI engineer reviewing the Alfred repository in the current working tree.

Objective:
Perform an honest, independent audit of the repo's readiness for:
1. alpha,
2. controlled testing with real client data,
3. eventual production use.

Constraints:
- Do not modify repo files unless explicitly asked.
- Do not overwrite or edit existing files in `memory\sensory\Recommendations`.
- If you are asked to write a recommendation file, first check the current issue map and backlog files. Update or reference existing findings when they cover the same issue; create a new file under `memory\sensory\Recommendations` only for a materially new review angle.
- Treat existing recommendation files in `memory\sensory\Recommendations` as inputs, not as truth.
- Verify claims against the actual repo, code, docs, scripts, policies, and runtime surfaces.
- Prefer read-only inspection and dry-run validation where possible.
- Distinguish clearly between:
  - documented,
  - implemented,
  - validated locally,
  - proven in repeated practice,
  - safe for client data,
  - production-ready.

Recommendation file rule:
If you write a recommendation note, place it under `memory\sensory\Recommendations` and include:
- From:
- Date:
- For:
- Purpose:
- Scope:

What I want from you:
1. Executive verdict:
   - Not ready
   - Ready for limited internal alpha only
   - Ready for tightly controlled client-data pilot
   - Ready for production
2. Findings first, ordered by severity:
   - P1 critical blockers
   - P2 serious gaps
   - P3 hardening or maturity gaps
3. For each finding include:
   - why it matters,
   - repo evidence,
   - exact file references where possible,
   - whether it is a code, runtime, documentation, workflow, governance, or operational issue.
4. Readiness assessment by stage:
   - alpha readiness
   - client-data pilot readiness
   - production readiness
5. What would have to be true for you to approve the next stage.
6. What other expert viewpoints are still needed, if any.
7. A short prioritized next-step list.

Role-specific focus:
Review this as an AI engineer assessing whether Alfred's AI-facing architecture, capability model, role model, memory model, and orchestration assumptions are coherent and production-credible.

Pay special attention to:
- whether the capability model is actually wired into execution,
- the gap between agent or skill abstractions and runtime implementation,
- whether memory boundaries are safe and usable,
- whether the repo can support reliable AI-assisted operation without hidden chat dependence,
- observability and control for AI-assisted actions,
- whether the current architecture can scale without creating unsafe autonomy.

Be strict about:
- architecture that sounds agentic but is really manual,
- capability layers that are documented but not operationally connected,
- weak state recovery,
- prompt and runtime mismatch,
- AI control surfaces that are not explicit enough for safe production use,
- overclaiming around autonomy, learning, or workflow coverage.

Output format:
- Findings first.
- Be direct.
- Do not soften conclusions.
- Do not treat aspirational docs as equivalent to implemented runtime behavior.
